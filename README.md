## Introduction-to-Java

What is Java?
•	Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
•	It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
•	Java is a popular programming language.
•	Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.
•	JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc and first released in 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
•	It is a simple programming language. It is popular in creating modular programs and reusable code.

Java Components
•	Java Code(.java) – this is the java code you have written, and its saved in the .java file(s)
•	Javac compiler – it compiles the java source code files (.java file) into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. The bytecode is saved in a class file by compiler.
•	Bytecode - this is what is produced by the javac complier after compiling java code.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
•	Generally referred as JVM, it’s the primary function is to execute the bytecode produced by compiler.
•	Each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems – hence Java is referred regarded as platform independent.
•	Program execution phases follows this general sequence write the program, then compile the program and run the program.

1)	Writing of the program is of course done by the java programmer like you and me.
2)	Compilation of program is done by javac compiler, javac is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java bytecode as output.
3)	In third phase, JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This is called program run phase.

Java Development Kit (JDK)
•	This is a complete java development kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.
•	You would need JDK installed on your computer in order create, compile and run Java program(s)

Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
•	JRE allows you to run java programs, it includes JVM, browser plugins and applets support. When you only need to run a java program on your computer, you would only need JRE.

Main Java features
1. **Platform Independence:**
   - One of the key features of Java is its platform independence. Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. The concept of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) is achieved through the compilation of Java code into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can be executed on any device with a compatible JVM.

2. **Object-Oriented:**
   - Java is a fully object-oriented programming language. It follows the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Everything in Java is treated as an object, making it easy to design modular and reusable code.

3. **Simple:**
   - Java was designed to be simple and easy to use. It eliminates complexities such as pointers, operator overloading (except for method overloading), and manual memory management. The syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners.

4. **Robust Language:**
   - Java provides strong memory management and emphasizes compile-time checking. It includes features like exception handling and garbage collection, which contribute to the robustness of the language. These features help in creating reliable and stable applications.

5. **Secure:**
   - Security is a top priority in Java. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) uses a variety of security measures to protect systems from malicious attacks. The bytecode is executed by the JVM in a secure sandbox, preventing unauthorized access to system resources.

6. **Multithreading:**
   - Java supports multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads. This is beneficial for developing applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

These features contribute to Java's popularity and widespread use in various domains, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise applications, and more. Java's versatility, combined with its strong support for networking and the ability to handle large-scale applications, has made it a preferred choice for many developers and organizations.

Writing First java Program
we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:		
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
•	Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
•	The name of the java file must match the class name.
•	hen saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
•	The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program.


Typical Structure of a Java program
Package declaration
•	A class in Java can be placed in different directories/packages based on the module they are used.
•	For all the classes that belong to a single parent source directory, a path from source directory is considered as package declaration.
•	Keyword package is used on package declaration statement.

Import statements
•	There can be classes written in other folders/packages of our working java project and also there are many classes written by individuals, companies, etc which can be useful in our program.
•	To use them in a class, we need to import the class that we intend to use.
•	Many classes can be imported in a single program and hence multiple import statements can be written.
•	Keyword import is used on import statement.

Comments
The comments in Java can be used to provide information about the variable, method, class or any other statement.
There are two ways to write comments in Java:
•	Single line comment - used to comment single line of code. It uses double forward slash (//) 
e.g. 	// this is a single line comment
•	Multiline comment -used to comment multiple lines of code
e.g. 	/*This is multiline  
              				 comment */

Class Definition
•	A name should be given to a class in a java file.
•	This name is used while creating an object of a class, in other classes/programs.
•	Keyword class is used on Class Definition.

Main Method
•	Execution of a Java application starts from the main method. In other words, it’s an entry point for the class or program that starts in Java Run-time.

Methods/Behaviours
•	A set of instructions which form a purposeful functionality that can be required to run multiple times during the execution of a program.
•	To not repeat the same set of instructions when the same functionality is required, the instructions are enclosed in a method.
•	A method’s behaviour can be exploited by passing variable values to a method.


## Java-Basic-Fundamentals
What is a variable?
•	A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
•	The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
•	A variable is only a name given to a memory location; all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
•	In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.
there are different types of variables, for example:
•	String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
•	int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
•	float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
•	char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
•	boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

How to declare variables?
•	To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value.
type variableName = value;
	Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String)
	variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name).
	The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.


Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John":

String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);


•	Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value.
int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);

•	If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword.
final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
There are three types of variables in Java:
1. Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called local variable.
•	These variables are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function.
•	The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these variables only within that block.
•	Initialization of Local Variable is Mandatory.

2. Instance Variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block.
•	As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
•	Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.
•	Initialisation of Instance Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0
•	Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.

3. Static Variables: Static variables are also known as Class variables.
•	These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.
•	Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
•	Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
•	Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0
•	If we access the static variable like Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it won’t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name to class name automatically.
•	If we access the static variable without the class name, Compiler will automatically append the class name.
•	To access static variables, we need not create an object of that class, we can simply access the variable as

Data types in Java
Data types are divided into two groups:
•	Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char(A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.)
•	Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes. ( These are the datatypes which have instances like objects. Hence, they are called reference variables)

Operators in Java 
Arithmetic operators 
Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the arithmetic operators −Assume integer variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then.
Operator	Description	Example
+ (Addition)	Adds values on either side of the operator.	A + B will give 30
- (Subtraction)	Subtracts right-hand operand from left-hand operand.	A - B will give -10
* (Multiplication)	Multiplies values on either side of the operator.	A * B will give 200
/ (Division)	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand.	B / A will give 2
% (Modulus)	Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns remainder.	B % A will give 0
++ (Increment)	Increases the value of operand by 1.	B++ gives 21
-- (Decrement)	Decreases the value of operand by 1.	B-- gives 19





Relational operators
 
Operator	Description	Example
== (equal to)	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A == B) is not true.
!= (not equal to)	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.	(A != B) is true.
> (greater than)	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A > B) is not true.
< (less than)	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A < B) is true.
>= (greater than or equal to)	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A >= B) is not true.
<= (less than or equal to)	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.	(A <= B) is true.

Bitwise operators 
works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation, assume if a = 60 and b = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows:
a = 0011 1100
b = 0000 1101
a&b = 0000 1100
a|b = 0011 1101
a^b = 0011 0001
~a = 1100 0011 
Operator	Description	Example
& (bitwise and)	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.	(A & B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100
| (bitwise or)	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	(A | B) will give 61 which is 0011 1101
^ (bitwise XOR)	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	(A ^ B) will give 49 which is 0011 0001
~ (bitwise compliment)	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	(~A) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.
<< (left shift)	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	A << 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000
>> (right shift)	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	A >> 2 will give 15 which is 1111
>>> (zero fill right shift)	Shift right zero fill operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand and shifted values are filled up with zeros.	A >>>2 will give 15 which is 0000 1111
 
Logical operators 
The following table lists the logical operators −Assume Boolean variables A holds true and variable B holds false, then: 
Operator	Description	Example
&& (logical and)	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.	(A && B) is false
|| (logical or)	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.	(A || B) is true
! (logical not)	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.	!(A && B) is true


The Assignment Operator
Operator	Description	Example
=	Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.	C = A + B will assign value of A + B into C


Java Classes and Objects
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint” or a factory for creating objects. This means without a class no object can be created.
What is a class in Java?
•	Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviour/state that the object of its type support.
•	To create a class, use the keyword class

A class is made up of:
•	Constructor - A constructor is a method called when creating an object from a class e.g public Person()in the example. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class. Some constructors may accept parameter and some may not.
•	Methods - A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the example given below run, walk and sleep are methods.
•	Variables/Properties - These are attributes they describe objects that are created from that class. 
What is an Object in Java?
•	Object is an instance of a class, i.e. they are created from classes. Objects have states/attributes and behaviours. Example: A dog has states - colour, name, breed as well as behaviours – wagging the tail, barking, eating.
•	an object is created from a class.
•	To create an object of Person, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:  and call the constructor to create the object for us


## Object-Bassic-Fundamentals

What is OOP?
•	OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
•	is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” that contain data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
•	OOP is faster and easier to execute
•	OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
•	OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
•	OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

OOP Core Features
The four main features of OOP are:
•	Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
•	Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
To achieve encapsulation in Java −
•	Declare the variables of a class as private.
•	Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
•	Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
1.	The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).
2.	extends is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class.

•	Polymorphism means to process objects differently based on their data type. In other words, it means, one method with multiple implementations, for a certain class of action. implementation to be used is decided at runtime depending upon the situation.
polymorphism can be implemented in two ways:
1.	Overloading in simple words means more than one method having the same method name that behaves differently based on the arguments passed while calling the method. This called static because, which method to be invoked is decided at the time of compilation.
2.	Overriding means a derived class is implementing a method of its super class. The call to overriden method is resolved at runtime, thus called runtime polymorphism.


Features of OOP – Other features
Coupling
Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.
Cohesion
Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.
Association
Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:
•	One to One
•	One to Many
•	Many to One, and
•	Many to Many
Aggregation
Aggregation is a narrower kind of association. It occurs when there’s a one-way (HAS-A) relationship between the two classes you associate through their objects. For example, every Passenger has a Car but a Car doesn’t necessarily have a Passenger. When you declare the Passenger class, you can create a field of the Car type that shows which car the passenger belongs to. Then, when you instantiate a new Passenger object, you can access the data stored in the related Car as well.
Composition
Composition is a stricter form of aggregation. It occurs when the two classes you associate are mutually dependent on each other and can’t exist without each other. For example, take a Car and an Engine class. A Car cannot run without an Engine, while an Engine also can’t function without being built into a Car. This kind of relationship between objects is also called a PART-OF relationship


## Decision-Control
Introduction to Decision control
When we need to execute a set of statements based on a condition then we need to use control flow statements.
Decision making structures have one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements that are to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

If Statement 
•	An if statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
•	Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.
•	If the Boolean expression evaluates to false, then the block of code inside the if statement (Statements) will not be executed
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

IF ELSE statement
•	An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
•	Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

The else if Statement
•	Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
•	An if statement can be followed by an optional else if...else statement, which is very useful to test various conditions using single if...else if statement.
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
Switch statement
•	Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.
•	A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.
•	Switch case statement is used when we have number of options (or choices) and we may need to perform a different task for each choice.
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
This is how it works:
•	The switch expression is evaluated once.
•	The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
•	If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
•	A break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block. When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break.
•	The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.


## Java-Modifiers
In Java, modifiers are keywords that you can add to the declaration of classes, methods, and variables to control their access, visibility, and behavior. There are two main categories of modifiers in Java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.

### Access Modifiers:

1. **Public (`public`):**
   - Accessible from anywhere. There is no restriction on access.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Private (`private`):**
   - Accessible only within the same class.

   ```java
   private int myVariable;
   ```

3. **Protected (`protected`):**
   - Accessible within the same package or by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).

   ```java
   protected void myMethod() {
       // ...
   }
   ```

4. **Default (Package-Private):**
   - If no access modifier is specified, it defaults to package-private, which means it is accessible only within the same package.

   ```java
   class MyPackagePrivateClass {
       // ...
   }
   ```

### Non-Access Modifiers:

1. **Static (`static`):**
   - The static keyword is used to create variables and methods that belong to the class rather than instances of the class.

   ```java
   public static int myStaticVariable;
   public static void myStaticMethod() {
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Final (`final`):**
   - The final keyword is used to indicate that a variable, method, or class cannot be changed or extended.

   ```java
   public final class MyFinalClass {
       // ...
   }
   ```

   ```java
   public void myFinalMethod() final {
       // ...
   }
   ```

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       public final int myFinalVariable = 10;
   }
   ```

3. **Abstract (`abstract`):**
   - The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

   ```java
   public abstract class MyAbstractClass {
       public abstract void myAbstractMethod();
   }
   ```

4. **Synchronized (`synchronized`):**
   - The synchronized keyword is used to control access to methods or blocks of code, preventing multiple threads from executing them simultaneously.

   ```java
   public synchronized void mySynchronizedMethod() {
       // ...
   }
   ```

5. **Transient (`transient`):**
   - The transient keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized when the object is written to an ObjectStream.

   ```java
   private transient int myTransientVariable;
   ```

6. **Volatile (`volatile`):**
   - The volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads simultaneously.

   ```java
   private volatile int myVolatileVariable;
   ```

These modifiers provide a way to control the access, behavior, and characteristics of classes, methods, and variables in Java.
